# [TR] §6.3 Frame and Anti-Frame  (physical pp. 22–27), Theorems 6.64–6.66

The three frame rules at the printed `wp` (`[TR]` p. 6): Imm Frame (6.64), Mut Frame
(6.65) and Anti Frame (6.66).  Each proof builds a *"fictional"* borrow cell —
`ℓ ↦ imm({α}, v, ρ_P̂(v))` or `ℓ ↦ mut(α, v, ρ_P̂(v), P̂)` — in place of
`ℓ ↦ own(v) ● ρ_P̂(v)`, runs `e` against it, and trades it back with the surgery
lemmas of §6.2 (6.24–6.29, 6.34, 6.38, 6.39).  The printed proofs of 6.64 and 6.65
open with Lemma 6.112 (`Иf`, §6.5), which is therefore declared in this file, ahead of
its subsection.

**How this file reads.**  The numbered results of the subsection, in printed order as
far as Lean's definition-before-use allows.  Each opens with a record:

* the result's number, page and the source inventory's status (`proved`, `proved*`,
  `variant`; source `docs/paper-inventory.md`);
* the printed statement, quoted, with the extraction's garbled symbols restored;
* the printed proof, transcribed compactly and in its own order, citing the lemmas it
  cites;
* the Lean declaration, moved from the source with its name, statement and proof
  unchanged (its docstring carries the source's tag and its account of the proof),
  and the numbered alias `TR.lemma_6_N` declared after it;
* the inventory row's note.

A result whose declaration an earlier subsection's printed proof needs is declared
in that subsection's file, under a heading saying so; its record and alias stay
here.  A run of declarations the paper does not print, placed in this file only
because a result below needs it and it needs a result above, is marked
`[about ours]` and names the result it serves.  Citations of `docs/…` and `BoCa/…`
are to the source repository (`borrow_lang` at `970a9d0`).

**The typed world.**  A result whose statement the source also proves at the typed
world — `wpTS` (row 5.33's repair) or the repaired relation `𝒱X`/`vShape` (rows
4.4–4.14's) — names that declaration in its record under *Typed-world version*; the
declaration itself is in `Support/TypedWorld/`, where a heading points back here.

### Lemma 6.112 (Иf)'s declaration, ahead of its subsection

`[TR]` prints Lemma 6.112 (Иf) in §6.5 (p. 31).  The Lean of Lemmas 6.64 and 6.65 in this file needs it, so it is declared here; its statement, printed proof and alias are in `Paper/S6_5_NonStandardEntailments/Lemmas.lean`.

[TR] derives it from 6.101, 6.99, 6.100 and 6.111; the bound `@ρ_P ⊓ β_Q` is
what that chain computes.  `[as printed]` -/

## Theorem 6.64 (Imm Frame) · `[TR]` p. 22 · inventory `proved`

> ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (Иα. Imm α P̂ –⋆ wp(e){[α](ℓ ↦ v –⋆ P̂(v) –⋆ Q̂)}) ⊨ wp(e){Q̂}

**Printed proof, transcribed.** Let `ρ` satisfy the left side (H1).  By Lemma 6.112, `Иα. ρ ∈ ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (Imm α P̂ –⋆ wp(e){[α](ℓ ↦ v –⋆ P̂(v) –⋆ Q̂)})` (H2).  Unfolding `wp` in the goal (G1), let `ρ_f # ρ` (H3); the goals are `ρ′ # ρ_f` (G2), `ρ⁺ # ρ′ ● ρ_f` (G3), `(⟦ρ_f ● ρ⟧, e) ⇓ (⟦ρ_f ● ρ′ ● ρ⁺⟧, v)` (G4), `ρ ↭ ρ′ ● ρ⁺` (G5), `ρ⁺|own = ∅` (G6), `ρ′ ∈ Q̂(v)` (G7).  Unfolding `И` in H2 gives `β` with `∀α ⊏ β. ρ ∈ [α](…)`; take `α ⊏ β` (H4) — *"such an `α` always exists because for any lifetime, the set of lifetimes shorter than it is infinite"* — and specialise (H5).  Lemma 6.104 splits the box (H6), and unfolding `⋆` and `[α]` gives `ρ = ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) ● ρ_b` with `ρ_ℓ ∈ ℓ ↦ v` (H7), `ρ_P̂(v) ∈ P̂(v)` (H8), `ρ_b ∈ Imm α P̂ –⋆ wp(e){…}` (H9), `@ρ_P̂(v) ⊐ α` (H10), `@ρ_b ⊐ α` (H11).  Let the *"fictional"* `ρᵢ = ℓ ↦ imm({α}, v, ρ_P̂(v))`, well formed by H10.  Compatibilities: `ρ_b # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H12: `▸◂` from `ρ`'s decomposition, `✓ρ` by Lemma 6.10 with H3); `ρ_b # ρᵢ` (H13) and `ρ_f # ρᵢ` (H15) by Lemma 6.34; `ρ_f # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H14) and `ρ_f # ρ_b` (H16) by Lemma 6.11; `ρ_f # ρ_b ● ρᵢ` (H17) by Lemma 6.15.  By `–⋆` with H9 and H13, `ρ_b ● ρᵢ ∈ wp(e){[α](…)}`; unfolding `wp` at `ρ_f` gives `ρ′ # ρ_f` (H18), `ρ⁺ # ρ′ ● ρ_f` (H19), the run from `⟦ρ_f ● ρ_b ● ρᵢ⟧` (H20), `ρ_b ● ρᵢ ↭ ρ′ ● ρ⁺` (H21), `ρ⁺|own = ∅` (H22) and `ρ′ ∈ [α](ℓ ↦ v –⋆ P̂(v) –⋆ Q̂)(v′)` (H23), i.e. `@ρ′ ⊐ α` (H24) and `ρ′ ∈ ℓ ↦ v –⋆ P̂(v) –⋆ Q̂(v′)` (H25).  By Lemma 6.29 with H11, H12 and H21, `ρ′ ● ρ⁺ = (ρ′ ● ρ⁺)/ℓ ● ρᵢ`; by H24 `ℓ ∉ dom(ρ′)`, so `ρ′ ● ρ⁺ = ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ ● ρᵢ` (H26).  Then `ρ′ # ρ⁺` (H27, Lemma 6.11); `ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H28, **Lemma 6.38** with H12, H27, H11, H24, H22 and H21); `ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ # ρ_f` (H29, 6.11); `ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) # ρ_f` (H30, 6.15 with H28, H29, H14); `ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) # ρ_f` (H31, 6.11); `ρ⁺/ℓ # ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) ● ρ_f` (H32, by H30); `ρ′ # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H33, 6.11).  Lemmas 6.26 and 6.8 with H12, H28 and H20 give `(⟦ρ_f ● ρ⟧, e) ⇓ (⟦ρ_f ● ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)⟧, v′)` (H34); Lemma 6.39 with H12, H28 and H21 gives `ρ ↭ ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H35); `–⋆` gives `ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) ∈ Q̂(v′)` (H36).  Setting `ρ′ ≔ ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` and `ρ⁺ ≔ ρ⁺/ℓ`: G2 by H31, G3 by H32, G4 by H34, G5 by H35, G6 by H22, G7 by H36.

**Inventory note** (source `docs/paper-inventory.md`, row 6.64). `Fig16.LogRel.wp_I_frame` (`BoCa/Fig16LogRel.lean`), on the printed carrier, `[as printed]` — [TR] p. 22's display at this file's `wp`, no premise added: the borrow is immutable, so the lender gets the **same** `v` back and there is no `∀v′` and no `P̂ ⊨ [β]P̂`. The printed proof step for step: 6.112 (`Fig16.BoLo.fresh_frame`) pulls `ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v)` inside the `N`, *"such an `α` always exists"* is `↓β`, and 6.104 splits the box over the `⋆`, its two conjuncts giving H10 and H11 (`Fig16.ResU.CompS.inStratum_right`). The *"fictional"* `ρᵢ = ℓ ↦ imm({α}, v, ρ_P̂(v))` is `Fig16.CellU.immOf` at `Fig16.LSet.singleton`, *"well formed by H10"* being that constructor's own typing argument. H12 is `▸◂` off `ρ`'s decomposition with `✓ρ` by 6.10; H13 and H15 are **6.34** (`Fig16.ResU.six34`); H14 and H16 are 6.11 (`Fig16.ResU.Hash.split`); H17 is 6.15 (`Fig16.ResU.hash_of_pairwise`). H26 is **6.29** with H11, H12 and H21 followed by *"by H24, `ℓ ∉ dom(ρ′)`"* — together `Fig16.ResU.six38_steps_one_two`; **H28 is 6.38** itself (`Fig16.ResU.six38`) with H12, H27, H11, H24, H22 and H21, and it is the step this row waited on. H29–H33 are 6.11 and 6.15 again; H34 is **6.26** under a frame by 6.8 (`Fig16.ResU.lower_swap_imm_own`), spent at both ends of the run; H35 is **6.39** (`Fig16.ResU.six39`), which returns `↭` with both validity conjuncts, so no separate 6.28-style step is needed; H36 applies the returned `─⋆` to the cell and the payload. The seven printed goals are then discharged at `ρ′ ≔ ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` and `ρ⁺ ≔ ρ⁺/ℓ`, in the print's own order. Was the cited `axiom` `wp_I_frame` until 6.38 closed. `immFrame_is_stated` there is an `rfl` unfolding, not a proof  **At the repaired `wp`.**  `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.wpTS_I_frameX` is this proof at `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.wpTS` with the record list carried: entry by `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.TW.immFrame` at the record and its lineage (`Fig16.LogRel.Typed.lineage_list`), tagged at the frame's `α`, exit by `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.TW.immEnd`; `[variant: …]` names `P̂ ≔ 𝒱X⟦T⟧δ`, `TW.immFrame`'s `AdmWf` premise, and `Q̂` stable along `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.Ext` (§12.70, §12.72)
-/
/-- **`[TR]` Theorem 6.64** (`Imm Frame`, physical p. 22):

    ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (⋔α. Imm α P̂ ─⋆ wp(e){[α] (ℓ ↦ v ─⋆ P̂(v) ─⋆ Q̂)})  ⊨  wp(e){Q̂}

The immutable-borrow analogue of `AntiFrame`/`MutFrame`: a lender gives up the
cell and its payload for the length of one run at a fresh `⋔α`, and — because
the borrow is immutable — gets the **same** value `v` back, not an arbitrary
`v′`, so no `∀v′` and no premise `P̂ ⊨ [β]P̂` appear (contrast 6.65's `MutFrame`,
whose payload may change).  The bare `Q̂` under the inner `─⋆` is the
postcondition at the run's own result, the same reading as at `wp_M_frame`:
6.172 (p. 45), which cites this rule as `ImmFrame`, applies `Q̂` to the pair the
run returns.
`[TR]`'s proof, step for step.  6.112 (`Fig16.fresh_frame`) pulls
`ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v)` inside the `⋔`; `α ⊏ β` is picked at `↓β`, *"such an `α` always
exists"*; 6.104 is the `[α]` the `⋆` is split under, and H10 and H11 are its two
conjuncts at the factors (`ResU.CompS.inStratum_right`).  The *"fictional"*
`ρᵢ = ℓ ↦ imm({α}, v, ρ_P̂(v))` is `CellU.immOf` at `LSet.singleton α`, *"well
formed by H10"* being that constructor's own typing argument.  H12 is `▸◂` off
`ρ`'s own decomposition with `✓ρ` by 6.10 from H3; H13 and H15 are 6.34
(`ResU.six34`); H14 and H16 are 6.11 (`ResU.Hash.split`); H17 is 6.15
(`ResU.hash_of_pairwise`).

H18 is the wand at that borrow, and unfolding `wp` under `ρ_f` gives H19-H23.
H26 is 6.29 with H11, H12 and H21 followed by *"by H24, `ℓ ∉ dom(ρ′)`"* — the
two together are `ResU.six38_steps_one_two` — and H28 is 6.38 itself
(`ResU.six38`) with H12, H27, H11, H24, H22 and H21.  H29-H33 are 6.11 and
6.15 again.  H34 is 6.26 under a frame by 6.8 (`ResU.lower_swap_imm_own`),
spent at both ends of the run, and H35 is 6.39 (`ResU.six39`).  H36 applies the
returned `─⋆` to the cell and the payload, and the seven goals are then the
print's, at `ρ′ ≔ ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` and `ρ⁺ ≔ ρ⁺/ℓ`.

## Theorem 6.65 (Mut Frame) · `[TR]` p. 24 · inventory `proved`

> If P̂ ⊨ [β]P̂, then ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (Иα. Mut α P̂ –⋆ wp(e){[α] ∀v′. ℓ ↦ v′ –⋆ P̂(v′) –⋆ Q̂}) ⊨ wp(e){Q̂}

**Printed proof, transcribed.** The shape of Theorem 6.64's, with `Mut` for `Imm`.  By Lemma 6.112 (H2); unfold `wp` at `ρ_f # ρ` (H3; goals G1–G7 as there).  Unfolding `И` gives `γ`; take `α ⊏ γ ⊓ β` (H4), which always exists, and specialise (H5); Lemma 6.104 splits the box (H6), giving `ρ = ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) ● ρ_b` with H7–H11 as in 6.64.  Let `ρ_m = ℓ ↦ mut(α, v, ρ_P̂(v), P̂)`, well formed by H4.  `ρ_b # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H12, Lemma 6.10 with H3); `ρ_b # ρ_m` (H13) and `ρ_f # ρ_m` (H15) by **Lemma 6.24**; `ρ_f # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H14) and `ρ_f # ρ_b` (H16) by 6.11; `ρ_f # ρ_b ● ρ_m` (H17) by 6.15.  By `–⋆` with H9 and H13, `ρ_b ● ρ_m ∈ wp(e){…}`; unfolding at `ρ_f` gives H18–H25 as in 6.64.  By **Lemma 6.27** with H11 and H21, `ρ′ ● ρ⁺ = (ρ′ ● ρ⁺)/ℓ ● ρ_m`, and by H24 `ρ′ ● ρ⁺ = ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ ● ρ_m` (H26).  `ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H27, Lemma 6.24 with `✓(ρ′ ● ρ⁺)` from H19 and H26); H28–H32 by 6.11 and 6.15 as there; Lemmas 6.25 and 6.8 with H12, H27 and H20 give the run (H33); **Lemma 6.28** with H12, H27 and H21 gives `ρ ↭ ρ′ ● ρ⁺/ℓ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H34); `–⋆` gives `ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) ∈ Q̂(v′)` (H35).  At `ρ′ ≔ ρ′ ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)`, `ρ⁺ ≔ ρ⁺/ℓ`: G2 by H30, G3 by H31, G4 by H33, G5 by H34, G6 by H22, G7 by H35.

**Inventory note** (source `docs/paper-inventory.md`, row 6.65). `Fig16.LogRel.wp_M_frame` (`BoCa/Fig16LogRel.lean`), on the printed carrier, `[as printed]` — `[TR]` p. 24's display at this file's `wp`, premise `P̂ ⊨ [β]P̂` included. The printed proof step for step: 6.112 (`Fig16.BoLo.fresh_frame`) pulls `ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v)` inside the `N`, *"let `α` be some lifetime where `α ⊏ γ ⊓ β`"* is `↓(γ ⊓ β)`, and 6.104 (`Fig16.BoLo.box_sep`) splits the box. `P̂ ⊨ [β]P̂` is what puts `P̂`'s resources in `Res_α`, which is what lets the *"fictional"* `ρ_m` be built at all.  6.24 is spent at H13 and H15, 6.15 (`Fig16.ResU.hash_of_pairwise`) at H17, **6.27 (`Fig16.ResU.six27`) at H26**, 6.25 with 6.8 (`Fig16.ResU.lower_swap_mut_own`) at H33 and 6.28 at H34. Was the cited `axiom` `wp_M_frame` until §31 and §32 carried 6.21–6.28 to the printed carrier. `mutFrame`'s body is 6.65 as printed, premise `P̂ ⊨ [β]P̂` included. The restriction is inhabited exactly once (`SurgeryTests.lean:227`, at `d=[ℓ]`, `P̂ ≜ ✓`, `mut` cells only), so the rule is non-vacuous and holds at no `𝒱⟦T⟧` — ledger D9  **At the repaired `wp`.**  `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.wpTS_M_frameX`, this proof at `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.wpTS`, entry by `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.TW.mutFold` (`Fig16.LogRel.Typed.ptoMutX_create`) and exit by `Fig16.LogRel.Typed.TW.mutUnfold`; the premise `P̂ ⊨ [β]P̂` is taken at every list, the stratified family's reading (§12.70)
-/
/-- **`[TR]` Theorem 6.65** (`Mut Frame`, p. 24): if `P̂ ⊨ [β] P̂`, then

    ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (⋔α. Mut α P̂ ─⋆ wp(e){[α] ∀v′. ℓ ↦ v′ ─⋆ P̂(v′) ─⋆ Q̂})  ⊨  wp(e){Q̂}

The lender gives up the cell and its payload for the length of one run, at a
lifetime `⋔α` shorter than everything in hand, and gets back whatever the
borrower left in the cell together with the promise that it satisfies `P̂` —
`[CONF]` Fig. 13a's `M FRAME`.  Three readings, none a change:

* `⋔α` is `Fig16.BoLo.fresh`, `[TR]` p. 6's row;
* the display prints the borrow as `Mut α P̂`, without its `ℓ ↦`; the proof's
  own `ρ_m = ℓ ↦ mut(α, v, ρ_{P̂(v)}, P̂)` and 6.66's display one page on both
  write the cell, and that is `ptoMut l α P`;
* the bare `Q̂` under the inner `─⋆` is the postcondition at the run's own
  result, as at `wp_M_antiFrame`: 6.173 (p. 46), which cites this rule as
  `MutFrame`, writes the binder out —
  `{v″. [α] ∀v′. ℓ ↦ v′ ─⋆ 𝒱⟦T₁⟧δ(v′) ─⋆ 𝒱⟦Ref T₁ ⊗ T₂⟧δ(ℓ, v″)}`.

The premise `P̂ ⊨ [β] P̂` is at each value, as `[CONF]` Fig. 13a prints it
(`∀v_p. P̂(v_p) ⊨ [β]P̂(v_p)`); it is what lets the proof's `ρ_m` be a
well-formed `mut` cell at the `α ⊏ β` it picks (§3).

over `BoCa/Wp.lean`'s machine, as every §6.7 rule there) -/

> ℓ ↦ Mut α P̂ ⋆ (∀v. ℓ ↦ v –⋆ P̂(v) –⋆ wp(e){∃v. ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (ℓ ↦ Mut α P̂ –⋆ Q̂)}) ⊨ wp(e){Q̂}

**Printed proof, transcribed.** Let `ρ` satisfy the left side (H1); unfold `wp` at `ρ_f # ρ` (H2; goals G1–G7 as in 6.64).  Unfolding `⋆`, `ρ = ρ_m ● ρ_a` with `ρ_m ∈ ℓ ↦ Mut α P̂` (H3) and `ρ_a` in the wand (H4); unfolding `ℓ ↦ Mut`, `ρ_m = ℓ ↦ mut(β, v, ρ_P̂(v), P̂)` for some `β ⊒ α`, `v` and `ρ_P̂(v) ∈ P̂(v)` (H5).  Specialise H4 to `v` (H6).  By 6.11 with H2, `ρ_m # ρ_a`; with `ρ_ℓ = ℓ ↦ own(v)`, Lemma 6.24 gives `ρ_a # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H7); likewise `ρ_m # ρ_f`, so `ρ_f # ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` (H8).  By `–⋆` with H6, `ρ_a ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) ∈ wp(e){…}` (H9); unfolding at `ρ_f` with H8 gives `ρ′ # ρ_f` (H10), `ρ⁺ # ρ′ ● ρ_f` (H11), the run (H12), `ρ_a ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v) ↭ ρ′ ● ρ⁺` (H13), `ρ⁺|own = ∅` (H14), and `ρ′ ∈ ∃v. ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (ℓ ↦ Mut α P̂ –⋆ Q̂(v′))` (H15).  Unfolding, `ρ′ = ρ″_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v″) ● ρ_b` (H16) with `ρ″_ℓ ∈ ℓ ↦ v″` (H17), `ρ_P̂(v″) ∈ P̂(v″)` (H18), `ρ_b ∈ ℓ ↦ Mut α P̂ –⋆ Q̂(v′)` (H19).  Let `ρ″_m = ℓ ↦ mut(β, v″, ρ_P̂(v″), P̂)`, well formed since `ρ_m` is.  `ρ_b ● ρ⁺ # ρ″_m` (H20, 6.11 with H11, then 6.24); `ρ_f # ρ_b ● ρ⁺ ● ρ″_m` (H21, H11 and 6.24); `ρ_b # ρ″_m` (H22) and `ρ_b ● ρ″_m # ρ_f` (H23) by 6.11 with H21.  Lemmas 6.25 and 6.8 with H21 and H12 give the run to `⟦ρ_f ● ρ_b ● ρ⁺ ● ρ″_m⟧` (H24); Lemma 6.28 with H20 and H13 gives `ρ ↭ ρ_b ● ρ⁺ ● ρ″_m` (H25); `–⋆` with H22 gives `ρ_b ● ρ″_m ∈ Q̂(v′)` (H26).  At `ρ′ ≔ ρ_b ● ρ″_m`, `ρ⁺ ≔ ρ⁺`: G2 by H23, G3 by H21, G4 by H24, G5 by H25, G6 by H14, G7 by H26.

/-- **`[TR]` Theorem 6.66** (`Anti Frame`, p. 25):

    ℓ ↦ Mut α P̂ ⋆ (∀v. ℓ ↦ v ─⋆ P̂(v) ─⋆
        wp(e){∃v. ℓ ↦ v ⋆ P̂(v) ⋆ (ℓ ↦ Mut α P̂ ─⋆ Q̂)})  ⊨  wp(e){Q̂}

A holder of the borrow recovers the owned cell and the payload for the length of
one run and hands the borrow back at the end, which is Pottier's dual of the
frame rule.  The bare `Q̂` under the inner `─⋆` is the postcondition at the run's
own result, and that is the reading below: 6.66's own proof discharges it as
`Q̂(v′)` for the `v′` the run returns, and 6.174 (p. 47), which cites this rule
as `AntiFrame`, writes the binder out — `{v′. ∃v. ℓ ↦ v ⋆ … ⋆ (… ─⋆ 𝒱⟦−⟧δ(v′))}`.
6.176 (p. 49) is the other citation, under the name `wp-m-anti-frame`, and the
one this file spends.
`[TR]`'s own proof, step for step.  `⋆` and `ℓ ↦ Mut` unfold to H3–H6, and
`ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` — which the print writes without comment — is
`ResU.compS_own_of_valid_mut`, off `✓ρ_m`.  6.24 (`Fig16.ResU.six24`) is then
spent four times, at H8, H9 and again at H20–H23 for the resource the callback
hands back, and 6.11 (`ResU.Hash.split`) with `ResU.hash_of_pairwise` is the
compatibility bookkeeping the print lists there.  The two wands give H10, and
unfolding `wp` at `ρ_a ● ρ_ℓ ● ρ_P̂(v)` gives H11–H15; `∃` and `⋆` give
H16–H19.  *"Note since `ρ_m` is well formed, `ρ''_m` is as well"* is
`ResU.valid_single_mut_of_wit`, by 6.23 at the payload's own `own` cell.  H24
is `ResU.lower_swap_mut_own` — 6.25 under a frame by 6.8 — spent at both ends
of the run, and H25 is 6.28 (`Fig16.ResU.six28`).  H26 is the inner wand, and
the six goals are then the print's own list.
